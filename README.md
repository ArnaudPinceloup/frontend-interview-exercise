# Front-end interview exercise
A short exercise to work on, as a first interview preparation


## Instructions
In this project, you will find a small front-end application built with React and some other javascript libraries.
Unfortunately, this webapp is not totally integrated, and it's broken ðŸ¤• !
Your mission, if you accept it ðŸ˜Ž, will be to finish what's missing and make it works.

- First, you have to get ready for development. Fork the project on github, and get the files on your computer, then setup the environment.
- Once you started the development server and opened your browser, you should see the single page app, with a "A" component.
- The "A" component is not fully integrated. With the 'component-design.png' as the reference, create the missing part of the component and style it appropriately.
- It looks like there is a bug in the interface. Find the reason, and solve it.


## Rules to remember
- It should take beetween 30 min to 2 hours to do it, depending on your approach and your knowledge. Don't make it bigger than what it is.
- Don't sweat it. If you're stucked, take notes of what you have so we can talk about it and see how to solve it.
- Don't hesitate to comment your code to explain what you are doing.
